# CSCI2020_Project

James Leblanc - Frontend

Sorry, gradle was very uncooperative but the task we set up is called runGame. To run the project you will need to run two instances of the same application on your machine. On the first instance select the "Host Game" option from the menu. On the second instance select the "Join Game". You will now be able to play the application between the two instances.
